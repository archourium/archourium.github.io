Archourium is a self-proclaimed startup dedicated to crafting thoughtful digital tools that help people operate at a higher level — more intentional, more reliable, more reflective.

The name comes from:

* **Arch** → the highest tier (ArchMage, ArchDuke, ArchProgrammer)
* **Orium** → “place” or “room”

**Archourium = The place for the Arch-tier builders.**
